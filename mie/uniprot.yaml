  title: UniProt RDF Schema
  description: 'Comprehensive protein sequence and functional information catalog
    integrating Swiss-Prot (manually curated) and TrEMBL (automatically annotated).

    Contains protein sequences, functions, domains, structures, variants, interactions,
    and cross-references to 200+ databases. Includes Gene Ontology annotations, enzymatic

    classifications, taxonomic organization, and subcellular localization. Critical
    quality distinction: reviewed=1 (Swiss-Prot, expert-curated) vs reviewed=0 (TrEMBL,

    automated). Essential for proteomics, functional genomics, drug discovery, and
    understanding protein biology across all organisms.

    - 'NEVER use up:mnemonic for filtering or pattern matching (e.g., FILTER(CONTAINS(?mnemonic,
      "_HUMAN")))'
    - 'NEVER use REGEX on mnemonics for content-based searches'
    - 'NEVER rely on mnemonic naming conventions for query logic'
    - 'Mnemonics are human-readable abbreviations that may change, have inconsistent
      formats, or be unreliable'
    DO:
    - 'Retrieve mnemonics with SELECT for display purposes only'
    - 'Use up:organism with exact taxonomy URIs for organism filtering'
    - 'Use up:fullName or up:recommendedName for protein name/function filtering'
    - 'Use up:scientificName on taxon objects for organism name searches'
    - 'Use up:Function_Annotation with rdfs:comment for functional text searches'
  rationale: 'Mnemonics (e.g., P53_HUMAN, KAPCA_HUMAN) are designed for human readability,
    not semantic queries.

    They lack standardization guarantees, may change over time, and do not represent
    the structured

    biological properties of proteins. Always use proper semantic properties (organism
    URIs, full names,

    scientific names, annotation comments) which are stable, structured, and semantically
    meaningful.

architectural_notes:
  schema_design:
  - Central hub entity up:Protein with reviewed property as critical quality indicator
    (0=TrEMBL, 1=Swiss-Prot)
  - Hierarchical taxonomy organization through rdfs:subClassOf relationships
  - Annotation system uses specialized subtypes with quality varying by reviewed status
  - Structured naming system ensures consistency in expert-curated entries
  - Cross-references via rdfs:seeAlso link to 200+ external databases distinguished
    by URL patterns
  - Mnemonics (up:mnemonic) are for human-readable display only, never for filtering
    or query logic
  performance:
  - CRITICAL - Always filter by up:reviewed 1 for computational feasibility and quality
    assurance
  - COUNT queries work efficiently with reviewed=1 filter (923K vs 444M entries -
    99.8% reduction)
  - Organism filtering highly optimized when combined with reviewed status
  - Text searches on full names perform well with reviewed constraint, timeout without
    it
  - Cross-reference joins most reliable and efficient for reviewed proteins
  data_integration:
  - Swiss-Prot entries have vastly superior cross-reference coverage to external databases
  - Gene Ontology integration most reliable for reviewed proteins (>85% vs ~30% for
    TrEMBL)
  - PDB structure links predominantly available for reviewed entries (~14-25% vs <1%)
  - Functional annotations significantly more complete in reviewed proteins (>90%
    vs 20-30%)
  - Pattern-based cross-reference organization enables efficient filtering to specific
    databases
  - Ensembl transcript annotations highly prevalent across reviewed proteins
  data_quality:
  - Fundamental distinction - reviewed=1 (Swiss-Prot expert curation) vs reviewed=0
    (TrEMBL automation)
  - Functional annotation completeness varies dramatically by review status
  - Cross-reference accuracy highest for reviewed entries across all databases
  - Sequence validation and modification tracking most reliable for Swiss-Prot
  - Computational tractability requires reviewed filtering for complex queries and
    aggregations

  performance_characteristics:
  - ESSENTIAL - Use up:reviewed 1 filter for all queries to enable COUNT operations
    and prevent timeouts
  - COUNT queries fail on full dataset but work perfectly with reviewed=1 constraint
  - Reviewed filtering reduces dataset 99.8% (444M to 923K) while preserving highest
    quality data
  - Organism + reviewed filtering optimized for taxonomic studies
  - Full name text searches efficient with reviewed constraint, timeout without it
  - Cross-reference joins most reliable and performant for reviewed proteins
  - Use URL pattern FILTER to access specific external databases efficiently
  - Recommend LIMIT 30-50 for exploratory queries to balance comprehensiveness with
    performance
  - Complex multi-property queries should always include reviewed=1 filter first
  data_quality_notes:
  - Reviewed=1 entries undergo expert manual curation vs automated TrEMBL processing
  - Functional annotations 90%+ complete for Swiss-Prot vs 20-30% for TrEMBL
  - Cross-reference accuracy and completeness dramatically higher for reviewed entries
  - Swiss-Prot provides gold standard for protein function, localization, and interactions
  - Computational tractability requires reviewed filtering for complex queries
