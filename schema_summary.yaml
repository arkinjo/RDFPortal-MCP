  title: DDBJ (DNA Data Bank of Japan) RDF
  description: 'The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) is a comprehensive nucleotide sequence
    database that collects and provides DNA and RNA sequences from researchers around
    the world. This RDF representation includes entries for complete genomes, chromosomes,
    plasmids, and other nucleotide sequences along with their associated features
    including genes, coding sequences (CDS), RNA features, and protein products.


    The DDBJ RDF database uses the INSDC (International Nucleotide Sequence Database
    Collaboration) ontology and FALDO (Feature Annotation Location Description Ontology)
    to represent sequence features and their genomic locations. It contains extensive
    cross-references to BioProject, BioSample, NCBI Taxonomy, NCBI Protein, UniProt,
    and Sequence Ontology (SO).


    Key features:

    - Over 262 million nucleotide entries

    - Over 225 million gene features

    - Over 247 million coding sequences

    - Detailed location information using FALDO

    - Rich metadata including organism information, taxonomy, and references

    - Cross-references to major biological databases

  title: Gene Ontology (GO)
  description: "The Gene Ontology (GO) is a comprehensive structured vocabulary for\
    \ annotating gene products \nacross all species. It provides a unified representation\
    \ of biological knowledge organized \ninto three independent ontologies: Molecular\
    \ Function (activities at the molecular level), \nBiological Process (larger processes\
    \ accomplished by multiple molecular activities), and \nCellular Component (locations\
    \ where gene products are active).\n\nGO terms are organized in a directed acyclic\
    \ graph (DAG) structure where terms can have \nmultiple parents and children,\
    \ allowing for rich and flexible biological annotations. \nThe ontology is widely\
    \ used for functional genomics, proteomics, and systems biology research.\n"
