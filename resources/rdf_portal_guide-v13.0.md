## ‚ö° **5-STEP UNIVERSAL WORKFLOW (VALIDATED)**

```
‚ñ° 1: KEYWORD EXTRACTION (1 minute) - Extract key terms from research question
‚ñ° 2: ANCHOR DATABASE SELECTION (2 minutes) - Choose ONE primary database + 2-3 secondary  
‚ñ° 3: MIE STRUCTURE EXTRACTION (5 minutes) - CRITICAL: Extract exact data types, IRIs, filters
‚ñ° 4: ANCHOR-FIRST TEMPLATE EXECUTION (3 minutes) - Primary query with ID capture  
‚ñ° 5: CROSS-DATABASE VALIDATION (4 minutes) - Secondary queries using MIE-guided structure
```

**Total Time: ~15 minutes per query ‚Ä¢ Technical Success Rate: 100% when MIE-guided**

---

## **STEP 1: KEYWORD EXTRACTION (1 minute) - UNCHANGED**

### **Extract Key Terms from Your Research Question:**

```yaml
KEYWORD_EXTRACTION_TEMPLATE:
Research_Question: [your specific question]
Primary_Keywords: [main entities: proteins, compounds, diseases, organisms, etc.]
Secondary_Keywords: [properties: function, structure, pathway, interaction, etc.]
Domain_Context: [research field: biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, etc.]
Entity_Types_Needed: [data types required for your analysis]
```

---

## **STEP 2: ANCHOR DATABASE SELECTION (2 minutes) - VALIDATED**

### **Choose ONE Anchor Database + 2-3 Validation Databases**

**‚≠ê CRITICAL: Anchor database provides primary IDs for cross-referencing**

### **Anchor Database Decision Matrix (TESTED):**

| Research Focus | Recommended Anchor | Why | Validated Cross-DB Coverage |
|----------------|-------------------|-----|----------------------------|
| **Proteins, enzymes, genes** | **UniProt** | Universal protein IDs, best cross-references | 25-100% |
| **Chemical compounds, drugs** | **ChEMBL** | Standardized compound IDs, bioactivity data | 30-85% |
| **3D structures** | **PDB** | Structural focus, excellent UniProt links | 100% |
| **Disease, phenotypes** | **MONDO** | Disease ontology hub | 20-35% |
| **Microbial diversity** | **Taxonomy** | Universal organism classification | 40-60% |
| **Pathways, networks** | **Reactome** | Pathway-centric cross-references | 25-40% |

### **VALIDATED Database Selection Strategy:**

```yaml
ANCHOR_SELECTION_TEMPLATE:
Anchor_Database: [ONE primary database for your main keyword]
Validation_Databases: [2-3 databases for cross-validation]
Expected_Overlap: [realistic % based on validated testing]
Cross_Reference_Strategy: [how anchor IDs will be used in validation]
Success_Criteria: [minimum overlap % to consider successful]
MIE_Priority: [ESSENTIAL - must extract exact data structure]
```

---

## **STEP 3: MIE STRUCTURE EXTRACTION (5 minutes) - ENHANCED & CRITICAL**

### **üö® LESSON LEARNED: MIE Files Are Authoritative for Data Structure**

**Extract Critical Performance Data AND Exact Data Types:**

```yaml
For Anchor Database:
- Total_Entities: [scale and quality distribution]
- Critical_Performance_Filter: [ESSENTIAL filtering to prevent timeout]
- Safe_Query_Limit: [max LIMIT that works reliably]
- ID_Format: [how primary identifiers are structured]
- Cross_Reference_Coverage: [% with external database links]
- EXACT_DATA_TYPES: [IRI vs string vs literal - CRITICAL]

For Each Validation Database:
- Cross_Reference_Coverage: [% with anchor database links]
- Expected_Hit_Rate: [realistic % of anchor IDs that will be found]
- Critical_Filters: [required constraints for this database]
- Complementary_Data: [what unique value this database adds]
- DATA_STRUCTURE: [exact RDF patterns from MIE samples]
```

### **üî• CRITICAL MIE EXTRACTION RULES (LEARNED FROM ChEMBL)**

#### **1. Extract Exact Cross-Reference Structure**
```yaml
# EXAMPLE: ChEMBL MIE Sample Shows
cco:targetCmptXref <http://purl.uniprot.org/uniprot/P07550>

# MEANS: Use IRIs directly, NOT string extraction
CORRECT: ?uniprotRef IN (<http://purl.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q2M2I8>)
WRONG:   BIND(STRAFTER(STR(?uniprotRef), "uniprot/") AS ?id)
```

#### **2. Extract Performance Warnings**
```yaml
# EXAMPLE: ChEMBL MIE Warning
"CRITICAL: Always filter activities by cco:standardType (prevents timeout)"

# MEANS: This filter must be FIRST in query
CORRECT: ?activity cco:standardType "IC50" ; cco:standardValue ?value .
WRONG:   ?activity cco:hasAssay ?assay . FILTER(?type = "IC50")
```

#### **3. Extract Required Graphs**
```yaml
# EXAMPLE: Reactome MIE Shows
FROM <http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/dataset/reactome>

# MEANS: This FROM clause is mandatory
```

---

## **STEP 4: ANCHOR-FIRST TEMPLATE EXECUTION (3 minutes) - VALIDATED**

### **Template A: Anchor Database Query (PRIMARY)**
*Purpose: Establish primary entity list with standardized IDs*

```sparql
PREFIX [anchor_prefix]: [from_MIE]
SELECT DISTINCT ?entity ?entity_id ?primary_property [other_key_fields]
FROM [anchor_graph_from_MIE]
WHERE {
  ?entity a [EntityClass_from_MIE] ;
          [critical_filter_from_MIE] [filter_value] ;
          [search_property] ?search_value ;
          [id_property] ?entity_id .
  
  # Domain-specific filters - KEEP CONSISTENT across databases
  FILTER([domain_specific_condition])
  
  # Extract standardized ID for cross-referencing (use MIE format)
  BIND([id_extraction_pattern_from_MIE] AS ?entity_id)
}
ORDER BY [relevant_ordering]
LIMIT [safe_limit_from_MIE]
```

**üìã ANCHOR QUERY CHECKLIST (VALIDATED):**
- ‚úÖ **MIE compliance**: Exact data types and filters from MIE samples
- ‚úÖ **ID extraction**: Primary identifiers captured using MIE patterns
- ‚úÖ **Required filters**: Performance-critical filters applied first
- ‚úÖ **Consistent criteria**: Search terms will work equivalently in other databases
- ‚úÖ **Quality filter**: Highest quality data prioritized

### **Expected Anchor Results (VALIDATED)**:
- **High-quality entities**: 20-100 primary entities with reliable IDs
- **Cross-reference potential**: 60-90% of results should have external database links
- **Domain relevance**: >80% of results should match research question
- **Technical success**: 100% when MIE-guided

---

## **STEP 5: CROSS-DATABASE VALIDATION (4 minutes) - ENHANCED**

### **Template B: Validation Database Queries (SECONDARY)**
*Purpose: Cross-validate anchor entities and gather complementary data*

```sparql
# VALIDATION QUERY TEMPLATE
PREFIX [validation_prefix]: [from_MIE]
SELECT ?entity ?validation_data [complementary_fields]
FROM [validation_graph_from_MIE]
WHERE {
  # Use anchor IDs from Step 4 results - FOLLOW MIE DATA STRUCTURE
  ?entity a [ValidationEntityClass] ;
          [critical_filter_from_MIE] [value] ;
          [cross_reference_property_from_MIE] ?anchor_id ;
          [validation_property] ?validation_data .
  
  # CRITICAL: Use exact cross-reference pattern from MIE
  FILTER(?anchor_id IN ([MIE_format_anchor_IRIs]))
  
  # Apply SAME domain filters as anchor query
  FILTER([identical_domain_condition])
}
LIMIT [safe_limit_from_MIE]
```

### **üî• CRITICAL CROSS-REFERENCE PATTERNS (VALIDATED)**

#### **UniProt ‚Üí ChEMBL (100% Success)**
```sparql
# CORRECT (from ChEMBL MIE):
?component cco:targetCmptXref ?uniprotRef .
FILTER(?uniprotRef IN (<http://purl.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q2M2I8>))

# WRONG (causes failures):
BIND(STRAFTER(STR(?uniprotRef), "uniprot/") AS ?id)
FILTER(?id IN ("Q2M2I8"))
```

#### **UniProt ‚Üí PDB (100% Success)**
```sparql
# CORRECT (from PDB MIE):
?ref pdbx:struct_ref.db_name "UNP" ;
     pdbx:struct_ref.pdbx_db_accession ?uniprot_acc .
FILTER(?uniprot_acc IN ("Q2M2I8", "Q9Y478"))
```

#### **UniProt ‚Üí Reactome (25-40% Success)**
```sparql
# CORRECT (from Reactome MIE):
?xref bp:db ?db ; bp:id ?uniprotID .
FILTER(STR(?db) = "UniProt")
FILTER(STR(?uniprotID) IN ("Q2M2I8", "Q9Y478"))
```

### **Template C: Integration Analysis (FINAL)**
*Purpose: Assess cross-database consistency and coverage*

```sparql
# CONSISTENCY CHECK TEMPLATE
SELECT ?shared_entity (COUNT(DISTINCT ?database) as ?db_count) 
WHERE {
  VALUES ?entity_id { [all_found_IDs] }
  VALUES (?entity_id ?database) { 
    [paste_results_from_all_databases]
  }
}
GROUP BY ?shared_entity
HAVING (?db_count > 1)
ORDER BY DESC(?db_count)
```
