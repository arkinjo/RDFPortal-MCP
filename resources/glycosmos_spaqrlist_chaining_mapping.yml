  title: GlyCosmos SPARQList API Chained Workflows
  description: |
    This YAML defines chains of atomic API calls from glycosmos_sparqlist_natural_lang_mapping.yml.  
    Each chain describes how outputs from one API can be mapped as inputs to the next,  
    enabling more complex natural language queries to be resolved step by step.

general_rules:
  - Chains are sequences of existing atomic APIs.
  - Each step explicitly states which output fields map into the next step’s parameters.
  - Chains should remain modular: intermediate results can be reused in other workflows.
  - The MCP should treat each step as independently testable.

chains:

  - chain_name: epitope_to_pubchem
    description: |
      Resolve a glycoepitope to external PubChem identifiers through GlyTouCan.
      Natural language queries like:  
      "Find PubChem compounds linked to epitope EP0009."
    steps:
      - api: glycoepitope_epitope_gtc
        mapping:
          epitopeID: from_question
        output_to: glytoucanID
      - api: gtc_external_id
        mapping:
          accNum: glytoucanID
        output_to: external_ids
    final_output:
      - glytoucanID
      - external_ids

  - chain_name: glycan_to_sequence_and_image
    description: |
      Retrieve both the structural sequence and a display image for a glycan.  
      Useful for questions like:  
      "Show me the structure of glycan G10219AA in both sequence and image form."
    steps:
      - api: gtcId2Seq
        mapping:
          id: from_question
        output_to: sequences

        output_to: image
    final_output:
      - sequences
      - image

  - chain_name: gene_to_uniprot_to_sequence
    description: |
      Map a gene in a given organism to UniProt, then fetch its amino acid sequence.  
      Example: "Get the sequence of human TNF protein."
    steps:
      - api: gene_and_organism_annotation
        mapping:
          tax_id: from_question
          gene_id: from_question
        output_to: up
      - api: uniprot_aa_seq
        mapping:
          up_id: up
        output_to: aa_seq
    final_output:
      - up
      - aa_seq

  - chain_name: glycan_cross_reference
    description: |
      Retrieve GlyTouCan accession → sequence → external IDs in one flow.  
      Example: "What is the sequence and KEGG ID for glycan G95616YE?"
    steps:
      - api: gtcId2Seq
        mapping:
          id: from_question
        output_to: sequences
      - api: gtc_external_id
        mapping:
          accNum: same_as(id)
        output_to: external_ids
    final_output:
      - sequences
      - external_ids
  
  - chain_name: disease_to_glycan_motifs
    descripttion: |
      Retrieve GlyTouCan accession number and the motifs that is associated with a given disease
      Example: “Please tell me about the glycans and their motifs that bind to the influenza virus.”
    steps:
      - api: disease_bind_glycan
        mapping:
          disease: from_question
        output_to: glytoucan_id
      - api: glytoucan_id_to_epitope_id
        mapping:
          glytoucan_id: glytoucan_id
        output_to: motif_id #need to revise to epitope_id
      - api: epitope_id_to_epitope_name
        mapping:
          epitope_id: epitope_id
        output_to: epitope_name
    final_output:
      - glytoucan_id
      - epitope_id
      - epitope_name
