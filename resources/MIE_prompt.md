# Create a compact yet comprehensive MIE file for __DBNAME__ RDF database.

## Philosophy: Essential over Exhaustive
Create documentation that is **compact, clear, and complete** - sufficient for researchers to effectively query the database without unnecessary bloat.

## 1. Discovery Phase (CRITICAL: Follow Systematically)

**⚠️ WARNING: Avoid Sampling Bias and Premature Conclusions**
- The first 50 results from a SPARQL query may NOT represent the entire database
- Always verify comprehensively using multiple query patterns before drawing conclusions
- Check ontology graphs for class definitions BEFORE sampling data
- Never assume timeouts mean "data doesn't exist"

### 1.1 Systematic Discovery Workflow

**Step 1: Check for Existing Documentation** (2 minutes)
- Use `get_sparql_endpoints()` to identify available endpoints
- Use `get_graph_list(dbname)` to find ALL named graphs (data + ontology graphs)
- Attempt `get_shex(dbname)` to retrieve existing shape expressions
- Attempt `get_MIE_file(dbname)` to retrieve existing MIE files
  - **If an existing MIE file is found**: Perform compliance check (see section 1.2 below)
  - **If compliant**: Update/improve the file as needed
  - **If non-compliant**: Create a new MIE file from scratch

**Step 2: Discover Schema/Ontology Definitions** (5 minutes)
```sparql
# Query 1: Get all RDF classes from ontology graphs
SELECT DISTINCT ?class
FROM <ontology_graph_uri>
WHERE {
  ?class a owl:Class .
}
LIMIT 100

# Query 2: Get all properties from ontology graphs
SELECT DISTINCT ?property ?type
FROM <ontology_graph_uri>
WHERE {
  ?property a ?type .
  FILTER(?type IN (owl:ObjectProperty, owl:DatatypeProperty, rdf:Property))
}
LIMIT 100

# Query 3: Sample property domains and ranges
SELECT ?property ?domain ?range
FROM <ontology_graph_uri>
WHERE {
  ?property rdfs:domain ?domain ;
            rdfs:range ?range .
}
LIMIT 100
```

**Why this matters**: Ontology graphs reveal what SHOULD exist, preventing you from missing entire entity types.

**Step 3: Explore URI Patterns** (5 minutes)

Test multiple URI namespace patterns to discover different entity types:

```sparql
# Pattern 1: identifiers.org/[namespace]
SELECT ?s ?p ?o
WHERE {
  ?s ?p ?o .
  FILTER(STRSTARTS(STR(?s), "http://identifiers.org/"))
}
LIMIT 50

# Pattern 2: Database-specific namespace
SELECT ?s ?p ?o  
WHERE {
  ?s ?p ?o .
  FILTER(STRSTARTS(STR(?s), "http://[database-specific-uri]/"))
}
LIMIT 50

# Pattern 3: Sample different prefixes found in ontology
SELECT ?s ?type
WHERE {
  ?s a ?type .
}
LIMIT 100
```

**Why this matters**: Different URI patterns often indicate different data layers (e.g., identifiers vs full records vs features).

**Step 4: Systematic Class Instance Sampling** (10 minutes)

For EACH class discovered in Step 2, sample actual instances:

```sparql
# For each class found:
SELECT ?instance ?p ?o
WHERE {
  ?instance a <ClassURI> .
  ?instance ?p ?o .
}
LIMIT 50
```

**Why this matters**: Prevents assuming the database only contains what you see first. Some classes may have millions of instances, others only a few.

**Step 5: Verify and Cross-Check** (5 minutes)

If queries timeout or return no results:
- ✅ Try with smaller LIMIT values
- ✅ Try without FROM clauses
- ✅ Try with different FILTER patterns
- ✅ Sample from different graph URIs
- ❌ DON'T assume "no results = doesn't exist"

### 1.2 MIE File Compliance Check

When an existing MIE file is retrieved, verify it complies with these instructions:

**Structure & Format:**
- [ ] Properly formatted YAML
- [ ] Contains all required sections: schema_info, shape_expressions, sample_rdf_entries, sparql_query_examples, cross_references, architectural_notes, data_statistics, anti_patterns, common_errors
- [ ] Schema_info includes version/license/access metadata

**Sample RDF Entries:**
- [ ] Exactly 5 examples covering diverse categories
- [ ] Each has concise 1-2 sentence description

**SPARQL Query Examples:**
- [ ] Exactly 7 queries (2 basic, 3 intermediate, 2 advanced)
- [ ] Includes: keyword filtering + biological annotations
- [ ] No cross-reference queries (those in cross_references section)
- [ ] All tested and working

**Shape Expressions:**
- [ ] Minimal comments (only non-obvious properties)
- [ ] Covers ALL major entity types

**Other Sections:**
- [ ] Cross-references organized by RDF pattern with all databases
- [ ] Architectural notes in YAML bullet format (not prose)
- [ ] Data statistics with coverage, cardinality, performance
- [ ] 2-3 anti-patterns with wrong/correct versions
- [ ] 2-3 common errors with solutions

**Decision:**
- If ≥90% pass: Update existing file
- If <90% pass: Create new from scratch

## 2. Schema Analysis (DO NOT SKIP)

**Critical First Step: Get Complete Class Inventory**
```sparql
# From ontology graph
SELECT ?class (COUNT(?instance) as ?count)
WHERE {
  ?instance a ?class .
}
GROUP BY ?class
ORDER BY DESC(?count)
```

**If the above times out, try sampling:**
```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?class
WHERE {
  ?s a ?class .
}
LIMIT 100
```

Then for each class:
- Query for sample instances
- Examine property patterns
- Identify required vs optional properties
- Check for hierarchical relationships

## 3. Deep Dive Investigation

For EACH major entity type discovered:

### 3.1 Property Analysis
```sparql
# Get all properties used by this entity type
SELECT DISTINCT ?property (COUNT(?value) as ?usage)
WHERE {
  ?entity a <EntityType> .
  ?entity ?property ?value .
}
GROUP BY ?property
ORDER BY DESC(?usage)
LIMIT 50
```

### 3.2 Relationship Mapping
```sparql
# Find relationships between entity types
SELECT ?type1 ?property ?type2 (COUNT(*) as ?count)
WHERE {
  ?entity1 a ?type1 .
  ?entity1 ?property ?entity2 .
  ?entity2 a ?type2 .
}
GROUP BY ?type1 ?property ?type2
ORDER BY DESC(?count)
LIMIT 50
```

### 3.3 Cross-Reference Discovery
```sparql
# Pattern 1: rdfs:seeAlso links
SELECT ?entity ?externalDB
WHERE {
  ?entity rdfs:seeAlso ?externalDB .
}
LIMIT 100

# Pattern 2: owl:sameAs links (or database-specific properties)
SELECT ?entity ?externalDB
WHERE {
  ?entity owl:sameAs ?externalDB .
}
LIMIT 100
```

### 3.4 Data Quality Assessment
```sparql
# Check property completeness (for coverage statistics)
SELECT 
  (COUNT(DISTINCT ?entity) as ?total)
  (COUNT(DISTINCT ?withProperty) as ?withProperty)
WHERE {
  ?entity a <EntityType> .
  OPTIONAL { 
    ?entity <PropertyToCheck> ?value .
    BIND(?entity as ?withProperty)
  }
}
```

**While testing queries, note patterns that fail (timeouts, errors, empty results) to document as anti-patterns.**

## 4. MIE File Construction

### Required Sections (in order):

1. **schema_info** - Database metadata + version/license/access info
2. **shape_expressions** - ShEx schemas for all entity types (minimal comments)
3. **sample_rdf_entries** - 5 diverse examples (core entity, related entity, sequence/molecular, cross-ref, geographic/temporal)
4. **sparql_query_examples** - 7 tested queries (2 basic, 3 intermediate, 2 advanced)
5. **cross_references** - Pattern-based organization with all external databases
6. **architectural_notes** - schema_design, performance, data_integration, data_quality (YAML bullets, not prose)
7. **data_statistics** - Counts, coverage, cardinality, performance_characteristics, data_quality_notes
8. **anti_patterns** - 2-3 common mistakes with wrong/correct versions
9. **common_errors** - 2-3 error scenarios with solutions

### Key Constraints:
- RDF examples: Exactly 5, each 1-2 sentence description
- SPARQL queries: Exactly 7, must include keyword filtering + biological annotations
- Anti-patterns: 2-3 examples showing wrong query → correct query
- Common errors: 2-3 scenarios with causes and solutions
- Keep everything concise - if it doesn't help query writing, omit it

## 5. Quality Assurance Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

**Discovery:**
- [ ] Queried ontology graphs for all entity types
- [ ] Explored multiple URI patterns
- [ ] Documented ALL major entity types

**Structure:**
- [ ] Valid YAML with all 9 required sections
- [ ] Schema_info includes version/license/access
- [ ] ShEx minimal comments, covers all types
- [ ] Exactly 5 diverse RDF examples
- [ ] Exactly 7 SPARQL queries (2/3/2 distribution)
- [ ] Required queries: keyword filtering + biological annotations
- [ ] Cross-references by pattern (not by individual DB)
- [ ] Architectural notes in YAML bullets

**Quality:**
- [ ] All SPARQL queries tested and work
- [ ] 2-3 anti-patterns with wrong/correct versions
- [ ] 2-3 common errors with solutions
- [ ] Statistics: counts, coverage, cardinality, performance
- [ ] Everything concise - no unnecessary content

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**❌ Sampling Bias**: First 50 results may not represent entire database → Check ontology graphs, explore multiple URI patterns

**❌ Premature Conclusions**: Query timeout ≠ "data doesn't exist" → Try smaller LIMITs, different patterns, alternative graphs

**❌ Incomplete Coverage**: Documenting only obvious entity types → Query ontology graphs first, create shapes for ALL types

**❌ Missing Error Guidance**: Not testing what fails → Note failing patterns during testing to document as anti-patterns
