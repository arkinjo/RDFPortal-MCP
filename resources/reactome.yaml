  title: Reactome RDF Schema Analysis using BioPAX Level 3 Ontology
  description: |
    This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Reactome RDF schema built on BioPAX Level 3 ontology.
    Reactome is a curated database of biological pathways that uses BioPAX standard for representing biological
    pathway data. The analysis focuses on how biological entities, pathways, reactions, and cross-references
    are structured and interconnected. Special attention is paid to cross-reference handling which enables
    integration with major biological databases like UniProt, ChEBI, Gene Ontology, and NCBI Taxonomy.
